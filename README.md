# Voltran Math

A tool that I developed for an FLL (first-lego-league) team that I take part in as a captain at my school operating like an extracurricular activity. We have an innovative project to develop ways to save unnecessary energy that consumes street lamps at night, and this tool that I've developed will help us do kinds of calculations we need.
